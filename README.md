2024 Bootcamp final project from Kaggle competition: NeurIPS 2024 - Predict New Medicines with BELKA

This prediction model for new medicine was developed based on "Big Encoded Library for Chemical Assessment (BELKA)". Dataset for SMILES of individual molecule and protein types were provided in Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/leash-BELKA/overview) and used to train this model for predicting molecule-protein interactions. 

1. python
partial data
RDkit

model selection - xgboost based on performance ()
optimization PCA analysis -- did not improve the model performance

3. Streamlit application 
When you upload csv file as input data, you need two types of data: (1) SMILES for molecules (molecule_smiles), (2) name of target protein (protein_name).


Limitation:
data used only partially - 
 GPU issue
 computing issue
 


Streamlit
Python
